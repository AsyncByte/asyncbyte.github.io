      <description>After being delayed for a while, finally I had a google developer account in August 2015. In July, I started making my first application that I would upload to the store. When I have an account, I can directly upload the APK. My first application is the Transjakarta Busway Navigator, an Android app to search for Transjakarta routes.
The idea of ​​this app came up because when I came to Jakarta, I completely have no knowledges about Jakarta, I needed this kind of app.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
