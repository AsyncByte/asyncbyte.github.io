      <description>After being delayed for a while, finally I had a google developer account in August 2015. In July, I started making my first application that I would upload to the store. When I have an account, I can directly upload the APK. My first application is the Transjakarta Busway Navigator, an Android app to search for Transjakarta routes.
The idea of ​​this app came up because when I came to Jakarta, I completely have no knowledges about Jakarta, I needed this kind of app.</description>
